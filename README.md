# Artificial-_Intelligence_Project

Create a read me include this : In this project we have solve the tower of Hanoi puzzle using A* search and BFS using 4 pegs and disc ranging from 2 to 10 i.e 2,3â€¦.10. The heuristics used are minimum Euclidean distance from the last peg of the large disk in each pole and Manhattan distance of the topmost disc from the last peg, which has been discussed further.
